# IDF

This is a package for random forest based face alignment, mainly comes from the paper: "Cascaded face alignment via intimacy definition feature"

The main idea of IDF is use scalar features to replace the binary vector features, which help the aligner keeps same level performance but achieves smaller size model and faster speed.
